# Apollo-Trivia

## Maintenance mode

Apollo Trivia is now in maintenance mode. This means that I am no
longer providing support / updates for this. If you are interested in
supporting it, email me.

This app was developed just to help me learn more about Android
programming and I really wanted to know more about the Apollo
missions. So I knocked out two birds with one stone and did
this.

It is no longer available from the Play Store, but you should be able
to download it from the
[releases
tab](https://github.com/jakevossen5/apollo-trivia/releases) or build
it from source.
